## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lumi!

I'm a furry that likes to code! Mostly in **Lua**, but I can also do **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** for both **frontend** and **backend**.
I'm comfortable reading **C/C++**, but writing it is still a hurdle.

I love **Linux**, it's my favorite operating system for a variety of reasons.

If you want to talk to me, here's my **Discord:** `@yagirllumi`

I also have a **YouTube** channel [`@coding_furry`](https://www.youtube.com/@coding_furry), I don't post often but I like to post my Beat Saber gameplay on there from time to time.

## My Projects

[**CC: Tweaked in Starfall**](https://github.com/NullLikesNothing/CCTweaked-in-SF) is a thing I made that allows you to run [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) programs inside Garry's Mod using the [StarfallEx](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx/) addon.

I also developed a [**Bouncy Circle**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_bouncy_circle) addon for Garry's Mod. Special thanks to [@Raphael](https://github.com/RaphaelIT7) for adding prediction!

* **Games:** Garry's Mod, Beat Saber, Buckshot Roulette, Just Shapes and Beats, N++, Minecraft, Starbound, Terraria, and the Half-Life series
